## How to Run Locally üç∏

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
     ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/git-samia/halal-restaurants-edm.git](https://github.com/git-samia/halal-restaurants-edm.git)
    cd halal-restaurants-edm
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configure Tailwind CSS:**
    Ensure your `tailwind.config.js` is set up to scan your React components (e.g., `./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`).
    Add Tailwind directives to your `src/index.css` (or `src/App.css`):
    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    @import url('[https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600;700&display=swap](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600;700&display=swap)');
    ```

4.  **Set up Google API Key:**
    * Obtain a **Gemini API key** from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/get-started/web) or Google Cloud Console.
    * In `src/App.js`, locate the `apiKey` variable and replace the empty string with your actual API key:
        ```javascript
        const apiKey = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE";
        ```

5.  **Start the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```
    The application will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
